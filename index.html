<p>Trezor Wallet incorporates multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods to augment security beyond hardware encryption, providing users with additional layers of protection against unauthorized access. These MFA methods serve as supplementary barriers to ensure that only authorized individuals can access the cryptocurrency stored in Trezor Wallet.</p>
<h3>PIN Protection:</h3>
<p>The primary layer of authentication in Trezor Wallet is the PIN (Personal Identification Number) protection. Users are required to enter a PIN code on the Trezor hardware device's screen before accessing their wallet. This PIN serves as the first line of defense against unauthorized access, particularly in cases of physical theft or unauthorized use of the device.</p>
<h3>Passphrase Encryption:</h3>
<p>Trezor Wallet supports passphrase encryption, allowing users to create an additional layer of security by adding a passphrase to their wallets. This passphrase acts as a second factor of authentication, ensuring that even if an attacker gains access to the physical device or the recovery seed, they cannot access the wallet without knowledge of the passphrase. Passphrase encryption significantly enhances security, especially in scenarios where the device may be compromised or in the event of a brute-force attack.</p>
<h3>Anti-Phishing Passphrase:</h3>
<p>In response to the threat of phishing attacks, Trezor Wallet offers an anti-phishing passphrase feature. Users can set an additional passphrase that is required to access their wallet, providing protection against phishing attempts. Even if users unwittingly provide their PIN to a phishing site, the anti-phishing passphrase ensures that attackers cannot access the wallet without the correct passphrase, thus preventing unauthorized transactions.</p>
<h3>Recovery Seed Authentication:</h3>
<p>When setting up Trezor Wallet, users are provided with a recovery seed—a series of randomly generated words—that can be used to restore access to their funds in case the device is lost, stolen, or damaged. This recovery seed serves as an additional authentication factor, allowing users to regain control of their funds on a new device. It's crucial for users to store this recovery seed securely, preferably in offline and physically secure locations, to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
